# Problem 1

## a, b

```

## c

### 1, 2

```{r}
which.max(wine_data$Alcohol)
```

> As the result gives 8, and we go back to the table, we can find that it is from class 1

```{r}
which.min(wine_data$Alcohol)
```

> As the result gives 115, and we go back to the table, we can find that it is from class 2

```{r}
mean(wine_data$Alcohol)

wine_data_1<-wine_data%>%filter(class=="1")
#mean(wine_data_1$Alcohol)

wine_data_2<-wine_data%>%filter(class=="2")
#mean(wine_data_2$Alcohol)

wine_data_3<-wine_data%>%filter(class=="3")
#mean(wine_data_3$Alcohol)

#wine_data%>%filter(class=="1")%>%filter(Alcohol)%>%mean()
```

#\> From the result we can say that the class 1 has the highest alcohol content, while the class 2 has the lowest alcohol content.

### 3, 4

```{r}
wine_data%>%filter(Magnesium>"114")%>%nrow()

wine_data_2%>%filter(Magnesium>"114")%>%nrow()
wine_data_3%>%filter(Magnesium>"114")%>%nrow()

> There are 122 wines having higher levels of magnesium than the average level of German beers; there are 30 in class 1, 59 in class 2, and 33 in class 3 having higher levels respectively.

## b

> This code can not run without modifications. Initially the code for rank was `ranks <- c(2:10, "Jack", "Queen", "King", "Ace")`, but when we tried to calculate the rank number and the configuration of our cards, the system can not calculate factors and the Console says `‘max’ not meaningful for factors`. Thus I changed this line to `ranks <- c(2:14)`.

> Moreover, initially it doesn't have the `Royal Flush` option, but realized it should be shown from the link provided in the problem set so I added it.
